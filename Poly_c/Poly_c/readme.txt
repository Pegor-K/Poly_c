This is the polynomial calculator, it will take the polynomials you enter in "input.txt" and calculate them.
The format must remain as it is set up in the input.txt file
For example, the first line will be the operations to be performed on the polynomial sets
The following lines will be the polynomial definitions themselves.
You may alter the operations performed in the first line, and add or remove polynomials as desired
Please be sure to enter additional polynomials in the same format they are given
Ex. "p5 4x4+2x3 + 2x".
Polynomials must be in descending powers
